				<h2>About Me</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>My name is Forrest King and I am a junior in the Game Design Program at george Mason University.
				I work in both visual arts and programming, but have a particular focus on the design of video games.
				My experise in the field comes from years of personal and educational development of games.
				
				I created my first video game in C++ when I was 16. It was a simple RPG boss rush called <i>Forrest's First Day: The Movie: The Game.</i>
				From then on I have worked on multiple other projects and eventually came to take game design as my major at GMU.
